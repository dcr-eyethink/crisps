It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

Out of nowhere, a wild, ridiculous idea struck him: *‚ÄúWhat if I could trade this paperclip‚Ä¶ and keep trading up until I get a house?‚Äù* His heart pounded. He laughed at the absurdity‚Äîbut then decided to give it a try.
His first trade was simple: he posted a photo of the red paperclip online and someone offered him a novelty fish-shaped pen in exchange. That pen led to a hand-sculpted doorknob, then a camping stove, then a generator, and eventually a snowmobile. As his trades gained attention, people from across the internet followed his journey, and the offers became more bizarre and exciting. At one point, he traded for a recording contract, then for a role in an actual Hollywood film.
Finally, after just 14 trades, the town of Kipling in Saskatchewan made him an unbelievable offer: *‚ÄúGive us the movie role, and we‚Äôll give you a house.‚Äù* Kyle accepted‚Äîand moved into his new home, keys in hand. What began as a joke became an internet legend. He wrote a book called *One Red Paperclip""* and inspired millions with his creative thinking and fearless ambition. Sometimes, all it takes to change your life is a tiny red paperclip‚Äîand the courage to start your own crazy game.""",paperclip pic.png,paperclip ID.png,23,13,5,55,,,,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

He laughed at the absurdity‚Äîbut then decided to give it a try.
His first trade was simple: he posted a photo of the red paperclip online and someone offered him a novelty fish-shaped pen in exchange.

As his trades gained attention, people from across the internet followed his journey, and the offers became more bizarre and exciting.

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When the Sun‚Äôs magnetic fields reconnect and create a solar flare, it sends out streams of charged particles. NASA‚Äôs Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, or IMAP, will track this solar wind as it reaches the boundaries of the solar system and interacts with the local galactic neighborhood beyond.

IMAP will also be able to help provide real-time observations of the solar wind as it approaches Earth, providing about a half-hour‚Äôs warning of harmful radiation for spacecraft and astronauts. As Artemis astronauts venture beyond Earth‚Äôs magnetic protection to the Moon and Mars, IMAP‚Äôs data becomes ever more crucial to fill in missing puzzle pieces that will help mission planners predict and mitigate the effects of space weather.

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

Out of nowhere, a wild, ridiculous idea struck him: *‚ÄúWhat if I could trade this paperclip‚Ä¶ and keep trading up until I get a house?‚Äù* His heart pounded. He laughed at the absurdity‚Äîbut then decided to give it a try.
His first trade was simple: he posted a photo of the red paperclip online and someone offered him a novelty fish-shaped pen in exchange. That pen led to a hand-sculpted doorknob, then a camping stove, then a generator, and eventually a snowmobile. As his trades gained attention, people from across the internet followed his journey, and the offers became more bizarre and exciting. At one point, he traded for a recording contract, then for a role in an actual Hollywood film.
Finally, after just 14 trades, the town of Kipling in Saskatchewan made him an unbelievable offer: *‚ÄúGive us the movie role, and we‚Äôll give you a house.‚Äù* Kyle accepted‚Äîand moved into his new home, keys in hand.

NASA‚Äôs Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, or IMAP, will track this solar wind as it reaches the boundaries of the solar system and interacts with the local galactic neighborhood beyond.

IMAP will also be able to help provide real-time observations of the solar wind as it approaches Earth, providing about a half-hour‚Äôs warning of harmful radiation for spacecraft and astronauts. As Artemis astronauts venture beyond Earth‚Äôs magnetic protection to the Moon and Mars, IMAP‚Äôs data becomes ever more crucial to fill in missing puzzle pieces that will help mission planners predict and mitigate the effects of space weather.

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

NASA‚Äôs Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, or IMAP, will track this solar wind as it reaches the boundaries of the solar system and interacts with the local galactic neighborhood beyond.

IMAP will also be able to help provide real-time observations of the solar wind as it approaches Earth, providing about a half-hour‚Äôs warning of harmful radiation for spacecraft and astronauts. As Artemis astronauts venture beyond Earth‚Äôs magnetic protection to the Moon and Mars, IMAP‚Äôs data becomes ever more crucial to fill in missing puzzle pieces that will help mission planners predict and mitigate the effects of space weather.

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

Out of nowhere, a wild, ridiculous idea struck him: *‚ÄúWhat if I could trade this paperclip‚Ä¶ and keep trading up until I get a house?‚Äù* His heart pounded. He laughed at the absurdity‚Äîbut then decided to give it a try.
His first trade was simple: he posted a photo of the red paperclip online and someone offered him a novelty fish-shaped pen in exchange. That pen led to a hand-sculpted doorknob, then a camping stove, then a generator, and eventually a snowmobile. As his trades gained attention, people from across the internet followed his journey, and the offers became more bizarre and exciting. At one point, he traded for a recording contract, then for a role in an actual Hollywood film.
Finally, after just 14 trades, the town of Kipling in Saskatchewan made him an unbelievable offer: *‚ÄúGive us the movie role, and we‚Äôll give you a house.‚Äù* Kyle accepted‚Äîand moved into his new home, keys in hand. What began as a joke became an internet legend. He wrote a book called *One Red Paperclip""* and inspired millions with his creative thinking and fearless ambition. Sometimes, all it takes to change your life is a tiny red paperclip‚Äîand the courage to start your own crazy game.""",paperclip pic.png,paperclip ID.png,23,13,5,55,,,,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film‚Äôs profits‚Äîsomething highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie‚Äôs release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around ¬£100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness‚Äôs share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history‚Äîa testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

Out of nowhere, a wild, ridiculous idea struck him: *‚ÄúWhat if I could trade this paperclip‚Ä¶ and keep trading up until I get a house?‚Äù* His heart pounded. He laughed at the absurdity‚Äîbut then decided to give it a try.
His first trade was simple: he posted a photo of the red paperclip online and someone offered him a novelty fish-shaped pen in exchange. That pen led to a hand-sculpted doorknob, then a camping stove, then a generator, and eventually a snowmobile. As his trades gained attention, people from across the internet followed his journey, and the offers became more bizarre and exciting. At one point, he traded for a recording contract, then for a role in an actual Hollywood film.
Finally, after just 14 trades, the town of Kipling in Saskatchewan made him an unbelievable offer: *‚ÄúGive us the movie role, and we‚Äôll give you a house.‚Äù* Kyle accepted‚Äîand moved into his new home, keys in hand. What began as a joke became an internet legend. He wrote a book called *One Red Paperclip""* and inspired millions with his creative thinking and fearless ambition. Sometimes, all it takes to change your life is a tiny red paperclip‚Äîand the courage to start your own crazy game.""",paperclip pic.png,paperclip ID.png,23,13,5,55,,,,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks

As Artemis astronauts venture beyond Earth‚Äôs magnetic protection to the Moon and Mars, IMAP‚Äôs data becomes ever more crucial to fill in missing puzzle pieces that will help mission planners predict and mitigate the effects of space weather.

It will share a ride to space with NASA‚Äôs Carruthers Geocorona Observatory. Carruthers will use its post nearly a million miles from Earth to view the exosphere, our home planet‚Äôs outermost atmospheric layer that plays a role in space weather.",nasa.png,nasaID.png,337,957,,125,32,,45,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,,sep_blocks
