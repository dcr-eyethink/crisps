When Star Wars premiered in May 1977, even its cast and crew had little idea of the cultural juggernaut it would become. Alec Guinness, already an accomplished actor with an Academy Award to his name, viewed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi with some skepticism. In fact, he reportedly found some of the dialogue clunky and even doubted whether the film would resonate with audiences. Yet, shrewdly, Guinness negotiated a deal that included a small percentage of the film’s profits—something highly unusual at the time for an actor in his position.
Just nine days after the movie’s release, Guinness confided in his diary that he was hopeful the percentage might yield him around £100,000 if the film managed to perform like Spielberg’s Jaws. What unfolded was beyond his imagination: Star Wars exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, earning hundreds of millions and spawning a multi-decade franchise. Guinness’s share ultimately netted him an estimated $95 million over the years for less than half an hour of actual screen time.
His decision remains one of the most legendary deals in Hollywood history—a testament to foresight, negotiation, and a little bit of luck. Obi-Wan Kenobi became not only an iconic character but also a financial windfall Guinness could never have predicted.",star wars image.jpg,starwars ID.png,,76,,45,,,55,,,,,,,social_media,1,filler,,

It's been like 'groundhog day' week after week the Severn has remained low - only water from Clywedog, Lake Vyrnwy and various boreholes stopped the river being reduced to a mere trickle in places.
We've had to wait until halfway through September for a decent lump of water. Today at Shrewsbury, the river was carrying just over a metre of lovely coloured, fresh water - having risen steadily overnight.
Yesterday afternoon I fished pellets for 3 barbel and two chub and the river was just starting to colour up as I called it a day. Today's session was the usual one rod approach, but I'd decided that a meat attack might be the best bet to find a few bigger specimens.
There was nothing complicated about my set-up, a 3oz lead and a foot long hooklink armed with a size four hook. To add a bit of extra feed into the swim, I'd made up some PVA bags containing pellets and small pieces of luncheon meat.
Needless to say, sunken weed and twigs were ever present. That's only to be expected with the first floodwater of the season - but casting upstream and relatively close to the bank went some way to alleviating the problem.
Happily, my four hour session turned out to be very successful - six good sized barbel reminded me what I had been missing during the hot summer. Strangely enough, the biggest barbel was the first fish of the session and in lovely autumn sunshine too.",fish pic.png,fishID.png,2,,,,1,,4,,,,,fishyPete,Nice!,social_media,1,filler,,

Out of nowhere, a wild, ridiculous idea struck him: *“What if I could trade this paperclip… and keep trading up until I get a house?”* His heart pounded. He laughed at the absurdity—but then decided to give it a try.
His first trade was simple: he posted a photo of the red paperclip online and someone offered him a novelty fish-shaped pen in exchange. That pen led to a hand-sculpted doorknob, then a camping stove, then a generator, and eventually a snowmobile. As his trades gained attention, people from across the internet followed his journey, and the offers became more bizarre and exciting. At one point, he traded for a recording contract, then for a role in an actual Hollywood film.
Finally, after just 14 trades, the town of Kipling in Saskatchewan made him an unbelievable offer: *“Give us the movie role, and we’ll give you a house.”* Kyle accepted—and moved into his new home, keys in hand. What began as a joke became an internet legend. He wrote a book called *One Red Paperclip""* and inspired millions with his creative thinking and fearless ambition.
